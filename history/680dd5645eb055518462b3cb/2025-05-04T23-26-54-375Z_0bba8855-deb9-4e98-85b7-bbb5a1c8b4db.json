I shared an apartment with two roommates, wed have impromptu jam sessions, writing songs, and playing music till the early hours of the morning. My friends were all about creating, pushing boundaries, and experimenting with art. A typical day started with a potluck breakfast at our place â€“ whoever showed up brought something to share. Wed grab some coffee from that one spot on St. Marks and watch the world wake up. After that, Id spend hours practicing guitar or working on music production. Weekends were usually reserved for gigs at some tiny club in the Village or just playing shows for anyone who wanted to come. Music was my everything back then â€“ it defined who I was, what I did, and how I connected with people. I felt most alive when I was lost in the noise of the city, creating something new and pushing against the status quo."
