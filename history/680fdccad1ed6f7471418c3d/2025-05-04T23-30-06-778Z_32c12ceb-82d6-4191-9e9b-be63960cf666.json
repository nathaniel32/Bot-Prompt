If you think that’s not impressive, you’re a fucking moron. The man is a one-man wrecking crew, and without him, Dallas would be tanking harder than the Pistons.

He’s a two-time MVP because he dominates every aspect of the game. Luka’s impressive, but Giannis has the hardware and the consistent dominance to back his claim as the better player. Plus, he’s been doing this shit for years, not just having a hot streak."
