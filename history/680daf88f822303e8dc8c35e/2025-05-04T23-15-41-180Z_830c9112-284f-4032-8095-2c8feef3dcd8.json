First off, the Summary section is a bit generic. What sets you apart from other Machine Learning Engineers? What unique value do you bring to the table? Consider highlighting your achievements and impact in previous roles. Next, the Technical ‚Ä¢ Languages ‚Ä¢ Tools section looks good, but Id suggest being more specific. Instead of just listing AWS, for example, try specifying the exact services youre proficient with, such as S3, EC2, or Lambda. Same goes for other platforms and tools. Now, lets talk about experience. While its great that youve had success with your projects, we need to see more concrete numbers and metrics. Instead of just stating 40% increase in sales, try specifying the actual dollar amounts or revenue increases. And please, for the love of all things good, spell out percentages (25% = 0.25, not % = .25). Lastly, what about some action verbs? Were looking at a lot of passive voice in this experience section. Can you rephrase these sentences to be more dynamic and concise?
