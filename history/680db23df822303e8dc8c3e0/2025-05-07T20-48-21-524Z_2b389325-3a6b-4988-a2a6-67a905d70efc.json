We need content that makes people laugh, think, or both at the same time. \nExample? A dance video breaking down complex AI concepts or a comedy skit roasting outdated tech. The point is to entertain and educate, all while building a loyal following that hangs onto every word. \nTakeaway: If you’re not willing to go all-in on creativity and spend the cash to back it up, you’re just wasting your time on TikTok. Let’s fucking do this."
